I have mixed opinions around story points. The other day I came across this picture, and I couldn't resist writing this
article.

Here is the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1524765566426173440)
by [Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub). I think the message is clear. **If you assign a time value
to a story point, you will have a hard time.** If your team is fantastic, and you estimate every user story
perfectly, even worse. You will set clear expectations with the stakeholders and fail.

Let's dig into the origin of story points.

## Story points. Where do they come from?

All fingers point to [Ron Jeffries](https://twitter.com/ronjeffries)
. [Here](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/story-points/Index.html) he explains how story points were created.
Long story short: story points are ideal workdays plus a load factor.

Management was completely lost. It looked like this: _
We have no idea how long it takes to implement; here is some number you can play with_. And you know what?
**We developers do not know how long it takes to implement a story many times.**

## What is a story point?

Let's have a look at [what Atlassian says](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) about story
points.

Every time I start working with a new team, I make sure we all agree on the meaning of a story point. Sometimes we focus
on
complexity, or dependencies, or unknowns. The definition is ambiguous and can change a lot from one team to
another. Some companies try to avoid this by creating a standard definition of a story point, or even worse, one unique
agile way of
working.

A question pops into my mind. What is not a story point? **It is not a unit to measure how
long it takes to implement a user story.** Does this conversation sound familiar?

> PM: Could you give me a rough estimation of this feature?
>
> EM: After some refinement, we find out the feature is about 80 story points.
>
> PM: Based on our velocity, it will take two sprints. We will finish in a month.

At first glance, story points may not look like a time unit in your organization, but if you combine story points,
velocity, and sprints, then you are using them as a time unit.

Story points, for me, are a tool with different purposes.

- **Identify lack of shared team knowledge**. When estimations differ a lot between team members probably someone is
  missing
  something. A database feature, a pattern already applied in another service, a tool for the task or knowledge from
  errors in the past. The
  more discrepancies you get, the less mature the team is.
- **Identify 'worthless' stories**. Sometimes, little features imply massive changes. The story points are pretty more
  significant than the value provided to the clients. How do you compare two abstract units like story points and value?
  That's up to your team!
- **Less stressful unit**. Team morale is easier to destroy measuring in hours rather than story points. The team
  estimates a user story in 8 hours, and it takes you 10 to complete. You suck.
